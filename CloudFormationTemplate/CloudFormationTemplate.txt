This is the notes of what I have learnt from Safari Online Course. This is for my reference only.
=================================================================================================
CloudFormation is a declarative way of outlining AWS infrastructure, for any resources.

For example, within a CloudFormation Template, yo say:
1. I want a security group
2. I want two EC2 machines using this security group
3. I want two elastic IP's for these EC2 machines
4. 1 want an S3 bucket
5. I want a load balancer (ELB) in front of these machines

The Cloud formation creates these resources for you in the right order, with the exact configuration specified.

Benefits of the Cloud Formation:
===============================
1. Infrastructure as code
2. This code can be version controller.
3. Changes to the infrastructre are reviewed through the code.

4. Cost:
   a. Each Resource withing a Stack is tagged with an identifier, so you can easily see how much a stack costs you.
   b. You can estimate the costs of your resources using the Cloud Formation Template.
   c. Saving Strategy: In Dev, you could automate the deletion of templates at 5 PM and recreated at 8AM safely. 
5. Productivity: 
   a. The ability to destroy and re-create an infrastructure on the fly.
   b. Automated generation of Diagram for your templates.
